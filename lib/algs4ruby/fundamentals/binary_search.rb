module Algs4Ruby
  # BinarySearch
  #
  # The BinarySearch module provides a method to binary search a key from a
  # sorted array of items.
  # 
  # The #index_of operation takes logarithmic time in the worst case.

  # prints those numbers to standard output that do not appear in the file.

      #   to a total order. The array has to be sorted. If the array is not
      #   sorted, than the result of the method is undefined.
      # @param key [Object(Comparable)] an element to look for in the array.

      # @return [Integer] the index of the key in the array if the key is found.
